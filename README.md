# HydraTouch
enables system-wide multitouch control of Windows using Razer Hydra 

The goal of this project is to enable full multi-touch control of Windows using Razer Hydra as an input device. You can point the controllers at the monitor, and two "touch cursors" appear on screen, as if you were pointing with two laser pointers (calibration required). By pressing a button on the controllers, you can execute click, hold, and drag touch inputs with either cursor.

The software functionality worked great, but the problem was with my Hydra system. The tracking worked well except for a "error-zone" near the monitor, where the tracking would drift to the left until I got really close to the monitor or moved further back, where it would drift back and correct itself. I never got around to contacting customer support about the issue.
